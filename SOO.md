# Electronic Filing — Case Management System (EF-CMS)

## Statement of Objectives

### Introduction

The United States Tax Court (hereinafter "Tax Court" or "Court") is an independent Federal court headquartered in Washington, D.C. The Court provides a national forum for the formal adjudication of disputes between taxpayers and the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"). The vast majority of Federal tax litigation occurs in the Tax Court. Approximately 27,000 cases were initiated in the Tax Court during 2017, and at the end of the year, there were about 22,000 cases pending before the Court. The Court’s mission is to adjudicate the cases pending before it fairly, efficiently, and quickly. [Appendix A further describes the Court’s structure and operations](Appendix_A.md).

The Court maintains a data network that operates in a Windows environment and supports approximately 250 internal users. (Appendix B describes the Court’s current network environment)[Appendix_B.md] in more detail.

The Court currently uses a legacy case management system that is not web-based. The Court holds a license to use the software that supports that system. Under the terms of that license, the Court is precluded from disclosing any programs, concepts, designs, or source code. This may be an important operating constraint for the Contractor because it will not be able to view or access the current system in any way.

The Court intends to deploy a new web-based electronic filing and case management system (hereinafter "EF-CMS" or "System") and transition from its current case management system at the earliest opportunity. The Court requests quotes from GSA Schedule 70 vendors to provide agile development services to develop that System.

Award will be made to the single Offeror whose proposal represents the best value to the Court. The Court intends to issue a Time-and-Materials type purchase order under an existing General Services Administration (GSA) Schedule Information Technology 70 (IT 70) contract, under SIN 132-51. The order will be for an initial period of one (1) year, and the Court will have options to extend the initial period for a total of up to two (2) additional years.

The Court will pay a not to exceed amount of up to $2 million for services and authorized travel during the first year, and up to $2 million for services and authorized travel during each of the two option years.

**Quotes are due by [TBD] and must be submitted electronically to clerk@ustaxcourt.gov.**

### Description of Work to be Performed

The Contractor must provide services that will include all aspects of the software development process, including initial planning, design, software development and coding, prototyping, documentation, testing, configuration, and deployment into the Court’s pre-production environment. The Contractor must use free, open-source software whenever possible. The Court intends that the code developed as a result of this project will be committed to the public domain.

This software development project will follow agile development principles, using free and open-source software, robust documentation, human-centered design, and an extensible infrastructure. The Court expects that the development process will be collaborative and iterative, with open, regular, and frequent communication between the Court and the Contractor. The Court has designated an employee who will be empowered to serve as the Product Owner for this project. The Court could also provide an individual with prior experience to serve as the Scrum Master for this project. Additional Court representatives will also be promptly available as needed to assist in the development process, including for user testing.

The Court expects the development process will consist of 2-week sprint cycles, and that the initial phases of the development process will focus on providing identity and access management, case initiation, payment of fees, search functionality, e-signatures, notes, and content management.

The Court intends to deploy the new System and convert operations from the current system as soon as the software for the new System has been sufficiently developed to provide the minimal functionality required to support the Court’s basic operations. The Court expects that development of the software and modification to the System will continue after this deployment and conversion.

### General Requirements

System Requirements — The Court’s future EF-CMS will be cloud-based and will have an intuitive web-based interface that is accessible from both internal and external platforms, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile devices. The System will have no single point of failure. The System will use elastic, dynamically-allocated computing resources that respond to changing demand. The System will include user authentication and authorization functionality that uses open source encryption protocols.

Software Requirements — The software architecture must be extensible to allow for future development. The code base must incorporate analytics, monitoring, continuous integration, and measurement tools. The Contractor must use plain language in application design and development whenever possible. The Contractor will not be responsible for hosting of the system or obtaining an Authority to Operate (ATO). The Contractor must post all developed code to a GitHub repository designated by the Court.
