## Evaluation Criteria

### Submissions

#### Due Date and Time

Submissions must be received by the Court on or before **TBD**. Any submission received after that date and time will not be considered, unless the Contracting Officer determines that consideration of the submission would not unduly delay the acquisition of the requested services.

#### Modifications, Revisions, and Withdrawals

Offers will be valid for one (1) year after submission. Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before award. Withdrawals are effective upon receipt of notice by the Contracting Officer. Offerors may submit written modifications to their submissions at any time before the solicitation closing date and time, and, if requested or allowed by the Contracting Officer, may submit written modifications in response to an amendment, or to correct a mistake, at any time before award.

#### Format

Submissions must be sent by email to [clerk@ustaxcourt.gov](mailto:clerk@ustaxcourt.gov). Submissions must be in two (2) separate emails, one containing the Offeror’s technical submission, and the other containing the Offeror’s price submission.  **Technical submissions and price submissions must be separate.**

#### Technical Submissions

Technical submissions must consist of a **technical proposal** of no more than three (3) pages, a **staffing plan** of no more than two (2) pages plus resumes and signed letters of intent, and **links to Git repositories**. Technical submissions that do not include each of these items will not be considered for award. The inclusion of caveats, assumptions, or exceptions to the requirement of any kind, in any part of the submission, will result in the Offeror not being considered for award.

The **technical proposal** must set forth the Offeror’s proposed approach to providing the services required, including the base software and programming language the Offeror proposes to use. The technical proposal should also make clear that the Offeror understands the details of the project requirements. The technical proposal should also identify potential obstacles to efficient development and include plans to overcome those potential obstacles. The technical proposal must also include a description of the Offeror’s plans, if any, to provide services through a joint venture, teaming partner, or subcontractors.

The **staffing plan** must set forth the Offeror’s proposed approach to staffing the requirements of this project, including the titles of each of the labor categories proposed and proposed level of effort for each member of the Offeror’s development team. The staffing plan must also identify the proposed Project Manager and proposed Technical Lead by name, and include a resume for each. Resumes must include a brief description of the experience and capability for each individual, but cannot exceed one (1) page in length. Offerors proposing Key Personnel who are not currently employed by the Offeror or a teaming partner must include a signed letter of intent. The staffing plan must set forth the extent to which the proposed team for this project was involved in the development of the source code in the Git repositories described in the next paragraph.

The **links to Git repositories** (either credentialed or public) must include at least two (2) sets of source code developed by the Offeror and accepted by clients for projects that are similar in size, scope, and complexity to the project contemplated here. The source code must have been delivered by either the Offeror itself, or a teaming partner that is proposed in response to this solicitation, or an individual that is being proposed as Key Personnel for this project. The source code references submitted must have been for projects that were completed within the past three (3) calendar years, with staffing profiles of approximately five (5) to nine (9) Full Time Equivalent (FTE) personnel. The projects must have either had periods of performance lasting no more than twelve (12) calendar months, or have been parts of longer projects for which working software was delivered to the client within twelve (12) calendar months of award.

#### Price Submissions

Price submissions must set forth a single dollar amount that represents the Offeror’s estimate of the total cost to the Court for the development services and travel expenses required for three (3) years of work on this project.  To set forth that single dollar amount, each Offeror must complete all tabs of the attached Excel workbook.  The first tab consists of the estimated amounts for the base year and the two (2) option years, and a total of those amounts.  The next three (3) tabs consists of pricing templates to be completed by the Offeror, one for the base period, and one each for the two (2) option years.  The figures in the first tab, including the total expected cost, will be auto-populated based on the information provided by the Offeror on the other three (3) tabs.

Offerors must set forth on each of the tabs 2-4 of the Excel workbook the labor categories, the total number of hours per year for each labor category, and the applicable hourly rate, that the Offeror proposes to use to provide development services for this project for the base year and each of the two (2) option years. Although each tab provides space for information regarding up to ten (10) separate labor categories, the Offeror should only submit hours and hourly labor rates for the labor categories that it expects to use. The Court expects that the labor categories and staffing levels set forth in the Excel workbook will be consistent with the Offeror’s staffing plan.

The Contractor will be compensated at loaded hourly rates. All proposed labor rates must be consistent with or lower than the Offeror’s GSA Schedule rates, and must be fully burdened (inclusive of profit, fringe benefits, salary, indirect rates, and the GSA Contract Access Fee (CAF)). The Court seeks further price reductions and Most Favored Customer (MFC) pricing for all labor categories. Offerors should provide their best discounted rates.

#### Interviews

The Offerors with the most highly rated written submissions will be invited to participate in an interview as part of the evaluation process. Each interview will be conducted remotely via video connection and/or teleconference. The Court will schedule the dates and times of interviews after the solicitation closing date.

Each interview will include an unstructured question and answer session during which Offerors will be asked questions about the technical aspects of their proposal and their approach to software development. The Court expects these interviews will assist the Court to assess the technical abilities of the proposed development team and to better understand the proposed technical approach described in the Offeror’s written quote. Both of the Offeror’s proposed Key Personnel must participate in the interview.

The Introductions phase of each interview will take approximately 5 minutes, and will be used solely for providing Offeror and Court team members’ names and roles.

During the Open Technical Session of each interview, the Offeror will respond to the Court’s questions related to the technical aspects of the Offeror’s proposal. Offerors will NOT be able to use or present slides, graphs, charts, or any other written presentation materials, including handouts. This part of the interview will not exceed 45 minutes. There will be no follow-up session for further questions after this part of the interview.

During the Closing Remarks portion of the interview, the Offeror may take approximately 5 minutes to make a short presentation summarizing the Offeror’s responses to the Court’s questions.

Interviews will not constitute discussions. Statements made during an interview will not become part of the agreement.

### Basis of Award and Evaluation Factors

Each submission received by the Court will be evaluated for technical acceptability. Submissions that are determined to be not technically acceptable will not be evaluated further.

Quotes must be realistic in both technical approach, staffing approach, and total price. Quotes that indicate a lack of understanding of the project requirements will not be considered for award. Quotes may indicate a lack of understanding of the project requirements if the staffing plan does not use a realistic mix of labor categories and hours, or if any hourly labor rates are unrealistically high or low.

The Court will evaluate technically acceptable quotes on a competitive best value basis using a trade-off between technical and price factors. Technically acceptable submissions will be evaluated based on three (3) technical evaluation factors. These factors are (1) technical approach, (2) staffing approach, and (3) similar experience. Each of these three technical evaluation factors is equally important.

The technical evaluation factors, when combined, are significantly more important than price. The Court may make an award to an Offeror that demonstrates an advantage with respect to non-price factors, even if such an award would result in a higher total price to the Court. The importance of price in the evaluation will increase with the degree of equality of the other factors, or when the Offeror’s price is so significantly high as to diminish the value to the Court of the Offeror’s advantage in the other factors.

#### Technical Approach

In evaluating an Offeror’s technical approach, the Court will consider (a) the quality of the Offeror’s plans to provide the open source, agile development services required, (b) the extent of the Offeror’s understanding of the details of the project requirements, and (c) the extent to which the Offeror has identified potential obstacles to efficient development, and has realistic approaches to overcome those potential obstacles.

#### Staffing Approach

In evaluating an Offeror’s staffing approach, the Court will consider (a) the level of the skills and experience of the Key Personnel and other individuals that the Offeror plans to use to provide the required services, (b) the mix of labor categories that will comprise the Offeror’s proposed development team, and (c) the Offeror’s proposed level of effort for each member of the Offeror’s proposed development team.

#### Similar Experience

In evaluating an Offeror’s similar experience, the Court will consider the extent to which the Offeror has provided software development services for projects that are similar in size, scope, and complexity to the project described in this solicitation, and the quality of those services. In considering the extent and quality of an Offeror’s similar experience, the Court may consider information from any source.

#### Price

In evaluating an Offeror’s price, the Court will consider the Offeror’s total estimated costs for the development services and travel expenses proposed for three (3) years of work on this project.
