# Case Management RFP
Developing an RFP to procure a new case management system for the court.

## Introduction

The United States Tax Court is an independent Federal court in Washington, D.C. The Court provides a national forum for the formal adjudication of disputes between taxpayers and the Internal Revenue Service.

Like all courts, the U.S. Tax Court uses a case management system to manage its caseload. The current system is a legacy, non-web-based system. The Court intends to develop and deploy a new, web-based, open source electronic filing and case management system, and transition from its current case management system as soon as possible.

Here we provide a draft of the Request for Proposals that we intend to release to solicit software development services to build our new case management system.

We intend to release the final RFP on July 20, with responses due August 10.

## Background

### What we're hoping to achieve as a result of this acquisition

We want a wholesale replacement of our case management system. Our goal is not to create a feature-level duplication of our legacy system, but instead to have a thoughtful software development process by which the various users of the system have their needs addressed. This is likely to involve substantial rethinking of some of our basic assumptions about what a case management system should do.

Further, we are hopeful that a modular approach to this work — by procuring a system comprised of loosely-coupled components that communicate via documented, standardized APIs — will result in software that can be of use to other courts at the federal, state, and local levels.

### How to respond

The purpose of posting this draft of the RFP is to solicit feedback from any interested parties, vendors and otherwise. It is our preference to receive feedback in the form of changes proposed as [pull requests](https://github.com/ustaxcourt/case-management-rfp/pulls), or by [opening an new issue](https://github.com/ustaxcourt/case-management-rfp/issues). In this way, feedback can be seen and discussed by anybody, instead of being available only to the Court. But for those who are uncomfortable with providing public comment on GitHub, or are unable to do so, we also accept comments via email at [`clerk@ustaxcourt.gov`](clerk@ustaxcourt.gov).

Note that we are not seeking proposals at this time.

### Contract Term

The order will be for an initial period of one year, and the Court will have options to extend the initial period for a total of up to two additional years.

### Budget

The Court will pay up to $2 million during the first year, and up to $2 million during each of the two option years.
