# Case Management RFQ

An RFQ to procure a new case management system for the [United States Tax Court](https://www.ustaxcourt.gov/).

## Introduction

The United States Tax Court is an independent Federal court headquartered in Washington, D.C. The Court provides a national forum for the formal adjudication of disputes between taxpayers and the Internal Revenue Service.

Like all courts, the Tax Court uses a case management system to manage its caseload. The current system is a legacy, non-web-based system. The Court intends to develop and deploy a new, web-based electronic filing and case management system that uses open source software.

Here we provide [a Request for Quotes (RFQ)](01_RFQ.md) to solicit software development services to build our new case management system. Responses are due no later than Friday, August 24, 2018.

## Background

### What we're hoping to achieve as a result of this acquisition

We want a wholesale replacement of our case management system. Our goal is not to create a feature-level duplication of our legacy system, but instead to have a thoughtful software development process by which the various users of the system have their needs addressed. This is likely to involve substantial rethinking of some of our basic assumptions about what a case management system should do.

### History

The Tax Court currently uses a legacy, non-web-based case management system to manage its caseload. The current system is based on vendor-developed software which the Court has a license to use. Under the terms of that license, the Court is effectively precluded from using any vendor other than the developer to modify that software. 

The Court issued a Request for Information (RFI) regarding a new case management system on FedBizOpps on December 1, 2017. The Court received twenty-six (26) responses to the RFI. Many of those responses suggested a solution that incorporated a particular COTS or software platform for which the Court would pay an annual license or subscription fee. 

The Court has carefully considered the responses to the RFI, and the pros and cons of obtaining a solution that would incorporate a COTS or a particular software platform, and would require the Court to pay an annual license or subscription fee. The Court seeks to avoid both platform lock-in and vendor lock-in. The Court is concerned that using a COTS or particular case or content management software platform would unduly restrict the Court’s future ability to switch to a new software platform. The Court is also concerned that obtaining a solution that is subject to licensing or subscription requirements would unduly restrict the Court’s future ability to contract with a new vendor for modifications to the software. The Court therefore seeks an open source solution without annual license or subscription fees, with no restrictions on future use.
